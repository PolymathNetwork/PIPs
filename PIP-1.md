## POLY Burn Mechanism for Polymath Services
A mechanism that increases the utility of POLY by requiring tokens to be burned to execute the creation of a token; thereby instilling intrinsic value via their necessity in the tokenization process, and also incentivizing clients and participants in the ecosystem to use and save POLY for their deflationary value. 

## Abstract
POLY is a proprietary transfer of value utility token that is used within an ecosystem of developers, lawyers, and service-providers. A burn mechanism could further augment the utility of POLY by giving it intrinsic value. This would also increase the value proposition of the POLY token further driving demand and liquidity, which is vital for its ability to be used.

## Motivation
While Polymath is building a marketplace of service providers for security tokens, beyond its optional use for STO fundraising, POLYâ€™s utility as a transfer of value token does not offer any specific incentive to exist or be saved other than speculation once transactions have taken place; and could therefore be seen by clients as a less appealing fundraising currency than alternatives like ETH, due to its embedded acceptance and additional utility. While Polymath could attempt to leverage its position as the top service provider in the security token space to forcibly corner STOs into using POLY, incentivization design being taken into account would continue to allow clients to use POLY as their currency of choice for STOs over other alternatives for its inherent value proposition, which could be augmented via a burn mechanism; in addition to being the proprietary currency of the highest quality security token protocol and STO service provider. A burn mechanism could provide the following multi-faceted benefits:

-Gives POLY intrinsic value, and critical utility
-Incentivizes more clients to choose POLY tokens for STO fundraising.
-Incentivizes participants of ecosystem to save POLY for capital appreciation.
-Allows for free-market approach whereby Polymath remains competitive.
-Incentivizes community to use and save POLY to invest in STOs. 
-Incentivizes participation in the developer community via POLY.
-Drives demand, increasing both volume and liquidity for Polymath clients.

## Rationale
Since POLY is used to transfer value, having a decreasing supply and rising price does not affect its utility. For example, if a client had to pay a percentage of their fees in POLY to a burn address, theoretically, it makes no difference if it was 1M POLY or .0001 POLY; since the amount is determined by market value, it would effectively be the same at time of purchase. Clients can send the POLY to a designated public address whereby they are sent to a burn address to be destroyed forever, which can be verified publically. 

Unlike Polymath offering a straight discount to clients for using POLY, which is indeed a viable concept for a short term, finite period of time, a burn mechanism eventually pays for itself, at least in part, by raising the value of existing POLY supply.

The better long-term value proposition that POLY provides, the more clients will choose it as the currency for STO fundraising of their own volition, which allows Polymath to remain highly competitive while further supporting the POLY token. This increased value proposition will also encourage more participation in the network by developers and investors via economic incentive. The magnified network effect will synergize with increased scarcity to provide more demand, support, and thus utility for the token.

## Backwards Compatibility
There is nothing that needs to be changed about the POLY or ST-20 protocols. 

## Functional Example
BNB - Both discounts for using BNB and quarterly burn.
RVN - Ravencoin asset layer is planned to require RVN burn in order to create tokens.
XCP - Counterparty has value because BTC was burned in order to receive it.

## Implementation

Theoretically, a percentage of POLY could be required to be burned for any actionable part of the Polymath services sequence. Whether it be in order to create a security token, upon each purchase or transaction in POLY, or to launch an STO, a logical and well thought out mathematical implementation of a burn mechanism is only one of many ways to improve on the economic design of the POLY token; and could even be used in conjunction with other features later on. It would have to be designed as such that the number burned could be adjusted over time, which might even be able to be done simply by pegging it as a percentage of the fee paid, which would automatically correlate to market price at the time.
